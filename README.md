# HousePricePrediction

# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

**Internship Project | NovaNectar Services Pvt. Ltd.**

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning models based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, parking, furnishing status, and more. It includes detailed steps of data cleaning, visualization, model training, evaluation, and error analysis to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset

- The dataset used is `Housing.csv`, sourced from Kaggle.
- It includes various features such as:
  - `area`: Total area of the house
  - `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms
  - `bathrooms`, `stories`, `parking`, `furnishingstatus`, etc.
  - `price`: Target variable (house price)
